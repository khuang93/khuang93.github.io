## About Me
Sensor Fusion Engineer at Fixposition AG. MSc Mechanical Engineering - Robotics from ETH Zürich. I have experience in Visual Localization and Mapping, GNSS, Sensor Fusion,  Pose-Graph Optimization, Extended Kalman Filter and Paricle Filter.

I was born in China and grew up there. I moved to Germany with my parents when I was 15. After finishing the German highschool (Abitur), I decided came to Switzerland to study mechanical engineering at ETH Zurich.

I speak Chinese, English and German fluently and can, after several years of struggle, also understand Swiss German. ;)
