## About Me
I am a graduating master student from ETH Z端rich Mechanical Engineering, Robotics. My focus is on Computer Vision and Visual Localization and Mapping.

I am born in China and followed my parents to Germany when I was 15. After finishing the German highschool (Abitur) I decided to study mechanical engineering at ETH Zurich and came Switzerland.

I can speak Chinese, English and German fluently and can, after several years of stuggle, also understand Swiss German ;)
