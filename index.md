## About Me
I am a graduating master student from ETH Z端rich Mechanical Engineering, Robotics. My focus is on Computer Vision and Visual Localization and Mapping.

I was born in China and grew up there. I moved to Germany with my parents when I was 15. After finishing the German highschool (Abitur), I decided to study mechanical engineering at ETH Zurich and came to Switzerland.

I can speak Chinese, English and German fluently and can, after several years of stuggle, also understand Swiss German. ;)
