## About Me
I am a graduating master student from ETH Zürich Mechanical Engineering, Robotics. My focus is on Computer Vision and Visual Localization and Mapping.

I was born in China and grew up there. I moved to Germany with my parents when I was 15. After finishing the German highschool (Abitur), I decided to study mechanical engineering at ETH Zurich and came to Switzerland.

I can speak Chinese, English and German fluently and can, after several years of stuggle, also understand Swiss German. ;)




## Projects & Experiences

### Academic
* **[Dense Object SLAM](./projects/mt_objslam.md)**
Master Thesis, [Computer Vision and Geometry Group](http://www.cvg.ethz.ch/index.php), ETH Zürich, 03.2018-10.2018
Supervisor: Peidong Liu and Prof. Marc Pollefeys

  * Dense SLAM using RGB-D cameras with semantic instance segmentation using deep learning.
  * Using alignment of depth information to creat a 3D reconstruction of each object.
  * Objects can be used as landmarks for localization and loop closure.
